# Speaker Visual Match

When podcast speakers record from different locations, the product should help their video look like one cohesive episode before any preset or canvas choices are applied.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to preview all speaker tracks side by side and quickly bring them into visual harmony so the finished episode feels like a single production.

## Match Signals

Flag mismatches that a viewer would notice:

- one speaker is noticeably darker or brighter than others
- color temperature differs across speakers (warm versus cool)
- one speaker's background is distractingly different in tone
- a guest's video appears washed out next to the host
- lighting changes within a single speaker's track over time

Signals should use plain language and thumbnail comparisons, not histograms or color values.

## Creator Controls

Use simple controls:

- match brightness across speakers
- warm or cool a speaker's look
- soften a distracting background difference
- preview the match against the chosen preset
- reset a speaker to original

Avoid exposing white balance sliders, color curves, LUTs, or per-channel adjustments in the default path.

## Review States

Use simple states:

- matched
- needs review
- skipped

These states should appear in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` Speaker Framing Warnings only when a visual mismatch would be noticeable in the finished episode.

## Connection to Preset and Canvas

Visual match adjustments should apply before the preset style layer so that brand colors, overlays, and lower-thirds look consistent across all speakers. Changes saved here should carry into `docs/show-template-adaptation.md` Template Contents when the creator reuses the same recording setup.

Source media issues that affect individual tracks before matching should surface in `docs/source-media-health.md` Health Checks. When source health detects a cross-speaker mismatch rather than a single damaged track, it should route the creator here instead of treating the issue as isolated media cleanup.

If the creator continues into layout editing, the corrected match should remain visible in `docs/canvas-layer-controls.md` Preview Guardrails so framing and brand decisions are judged against the harmonized speaker look rather than the untreated recordings.

## Preview Contexts

Creators should judge visual matching on the episode moments where mismatches are easiest to notice:

- all speaker thumbnails lined up side by side
- a host-and-guest split screen
- a solo close-up of the speaker being adjusted
- the match shown under the chosen preset with brand colors and lower-thirds
- a darker or backlit moment in one speaker's track

Compare the adjusted speaker against at least one other participant in the same view, and keep the chosen preset framing visible so the match still feels natural once the episode is styled.

Avoid exposing scopes, histograms, or per-frame color readouts in these previews.
